# Build Output

This folder contains the static HTML files generated by the build tool.

The build currently writes four identical pages (index, projects, links, about) because the site was converted from an older portfolio with separate routes. Some external documentation and bookmarks still point to those paths, so the build keeps them for compatibility.

## Generate a Single Page

To output only one file:

1. Open [../crissy-data.json](../crissy-data.json) and set `site.outputFiles` to `["index.html"]`.
2. Run the build tool again.
3. Remove the extra files from this folder if they remain.

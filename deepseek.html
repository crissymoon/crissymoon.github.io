<h2 class="border_box_shadow_topic">DeepSeek AI Tutorial Using Python, Last Updated: 3/29/2025</h2>


<!-- intro -->
<p class="border_box_shadow_p">
In this tutorial, I'll be diving into <a href="https://www.deepseek.com/en" target="_blank">DeepSeek AI</a>
 using Python. It's worth mentioning that DeepSeek AI does come with a cost, like $2.12, to start, which will last a long time and allow you to make something before moving forward with using it on a larger scale. I want to point out that AI is changing the game across all tech devices. As I progress with these tutorials and any other content on this portfolio page, I'll be highlighting how crucial it is to keep up with this technology and how it can significantly boost productivity. I plan to use <a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Prism.js</a>
 to make the code in this overview look nice and polished. 
<br><br>
A few people have asked me to add some other Python features to the code, like for and while loops and error handling, which are really important when working with APIs. I'm also planning to include a simplified explanation in this walkthrough, which will be helpful as the use of the Python programming language is currently growing quickly.
<br><br>
It's important to realize that some functions will work, no questions asked. Keeping a solid source code file or database with working scripts/snippets and the programming language version commented within is a good practice. The first step in creating any app is figuring out what you want it to do and sticking to that plan; otherwise, it might end up unfinished or never-ending.
<br><br>
Goal: Say hello to DeepSeek AI, and it’ll respond with a friendly greeting that includes a sense of a real-time reply without any hiccups. It’ll also have a way to stop and restart the app, plus options for asking more questions while showing all possible errors and running until a stop is requested. This will be used later to run quick tests on different AI models.
<br><br>
I'll drop the whole code down below, and then we can chat (w/AI) about how to get this done with some help from the AI model!
<br><br>
<b>Note(s):</b> 
<br>
The internet speed test is set to False within the code, as it will only be needed for testing in case of possible connectivity issues.
<br>
Just a heads up with this tutorial: it’s assumed that you’ve already got Python, PIP, and a source code editor set up on your system. If you haven’t, make sure to check out the first <a href="openai.html" target="_blank">OpenAI tutorial by clicking here</a>.

Goals/Objectives:
1. Get this code up and running on your own setup.
2. Make sure the response feels like it's happening in real-time.
3. Use this code to create something of your own.
4. Work on managing all errors smoothly so that our application 
   continues to run without interruptions when using the API.
5. Dive into some fun techniques to help you spot errors quickly and easily!

You can really explore and learn to create just about anything with this technology! 
Just remember to use it wisely and have fun!

We can make a few minor tweaks, and there might be some repeated code in what we’ve got.
Let’s check out the challenges below and see if you can apply some programming techniques 
or combine those two identical code sections into one function and tailor something to 
assist with a task of your own.

Remember, it’s okay not to strive for perfection! Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. 
Simple, clean code is often more enjoyable to read and understand. 
Trying to cater to every single programming principle can slow you down, so aim to keep 
things as straightforward as possible. #What is an opinion? #don't come at me #lol
Always consider how to handle errors, and think about explaining 
your code to someone who’s new to programming. Happy coding!

Challenges/Ask the AI model: 

What are the SOLID programming principles in Python?

When or when not to use a class in Python?

In which scenarios is it best to use a for loop, recursion, or a while loop in Python?

How do I incorporate GUI into my Python program?

What is importing a module/library in Python?

How to format a string in Python?

What is a Boolean in Python?

What is indentation in Python?

Think of this script as a fun puzzle for your new project. 
Why not give it a shot by removing all the comments while keeping everything nicely indented? 
You might be surprised by how it turns out! 
You can even create a personalized bot and use it as a tool to learn new languages. 
Have fun with it!

Alright, here we go! If you've successfully finished the basic <a href="openai.html" target="_blank">OpenAI tutorial</a> previously, you should be all set to run this code without any issues. Just make sure you've got all the necessary modules/libraries installed. Oh, and remember to check the internet speed setting—if it’s currently set to “False,” try switching it to “True.” Also, look for any parts of the code lacking comments and consider adding some! Creating a handy reference file/cheat sheet could significantly enhance your speed of developing applications.
<br><br>
If you need to chat with one of these AI models, ask away! If you encounter any errors, just let them know.<br>

<b>**VERY IMPORTANT**</b>
<br><br>
Just a heads up: in the code above, where it says "your-api-key-goes-here," you'll want to swap that out with your actual API Key.


<br><br><br>
<b>**RECAP**</b>
<br><br>
We set out to create a real-time response system for the DeepSeek AI model, and it turned out to be quite an exciting journey! We started by asking ourselves important questions about what it takes to have a real-time conversation. For instance, knowing the current day and time and our location can be helpful.
<br> 
Since we're working with API usage, we also wanted to ensure we handle any errors that might pop up in our code. We decided that displaying all the errors for now was a good idea, as sometimes things can go wrong outside of the code itself with API usage. Ultimately, we were thrilled with the results—we interacted in real time!
<br><br><br>

<b>**Down-to-Earth Definitions**</b>
<br><br>
<b>Recursion:</b>&nbspA programming technique in which a function calls itself, either directly or indirectly, to tackle a problem. This approach simplifies a complex issue by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. It continues to do this until it arrives at a base case, which can be solved without additional recursion.<br><br>
<b>While Loop:</b>&nbspA while loop is a key control structure in programming that enables a block of code to run repeatedly as long as a specific condition remains true. It's beneficial for tasks where the number of iterations isn't predetermined and relies on a changing condition.<br><br>
<b>If Statement:</b>&nbspAn if statement is a basic control structure in programming that enables you to run a block of code based on the truth of a particular condition. It allows you to make decisions in your code, executing different actions depending on whether the condition evaluates to true or false.<br><br>

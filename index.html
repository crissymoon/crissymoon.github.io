Greetings,
<br><br>
While the name may not align with the website address above, EDITZ serves as a brand I’m developing for office applications and Personal AI Agents primarily built in Python. I focus on fostering innovative ideas and facilitating collaboration with others to establish a standardized approach to data management. This process will entail conversing and collaborating with individuals to tailor an AI agent and automation for handling tasks. By leveraging AI and LLMs, I aim to create simple applications that can reduce hours of data entry to just 30 minutes or less. Or hours of content creation to a streamlined process allowing the ability to keep everything up-to-date. Imagine if you are tasked with making advertisements, scheduling, data analysis, etc., and can set a few options and turn the task from 4 to 5 hours to 30 minutes.  Most importantly, I hope to ignite creativity in this ever-evolving field.

**3-24-2025**—I wanted to share some friendly instructions for the website mock-ups after receiving valuable feedback from a thoughtful email that prefers to stay anonymous. I truly appreciate all suggestions, as they help create something lasting and fantastic! 
<br><br>
**Instructions:**
In the top right corner of the images, you’ll find a full-screen button that you can click. There are arrows on both sides of the images to help you scroll through them easily. And if you’re using a mobile device, it’s best to turn your phone sideways for a better view. Enjoy!
